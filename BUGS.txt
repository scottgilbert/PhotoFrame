This code has a few of built-in assumptions, limitations, and just bad
choices. 

Here I will try to document these various "flaws":

"Good" photos are assumed to have a "a" suffix, which used to be a convention
we used whenever we editted a photo. Over time, this is a less and less
useful way to identify "good" photos.

There is a little "hardcoding", such as the text "Jaques".

Photos are assumed to be in jpeg format (more specifically, only files ending
with the glob ".j*g" are selected.

Photos are assumed to have the date they were taken somewhere in their path.
(typically either in a directory named with the date, or the filename itself)

Inconsistency:  "recent" pictures are determined based on file mtime.  But, 
anniversay pictures are determed based on directory/file name, ignoring mtime.

Anniversary pictures are hardcoded for "today's date plus or minus one day". It
would be nice to have this range be configurable.

The timing of when photo display starts and stops is defined by both a cron job
AND in the photo_frame_boot_start.sh script.  It would be nice to have a way to
define this timing in just one place to eliminate the opportunity for
inconsistencies.

Sometimes after a reboot, photo_frame starts and runs normally, but no images
are displayed.  Running the stop script followed by the start script resolves
the problem.  I don't know what is causing this.
