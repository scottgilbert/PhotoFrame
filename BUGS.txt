This code has a few built-in assumptions and limitations.

Here I will try to document these various "flaws":

"Good" photos are assumed to have a "a" suffix, which used to be a convention
we used whenever we editted a photo. Over time, this is a less and less
useful way to identify "good" photos.

Photos are assumed to be in jpeg format (more specifically, only files ending
with the glob ".j*g" are selected.

Photos are assumed to have the date they were taken somewhere in their path.
(typically either in a directory named with the date, or the filename itself)

Inconsistency:  "recent" pictures are determined based on file mtime.  But, 
anniversay pictures are determed based on directory/file name, ignoring mtime.

Anniversary pictures are hardcoded for "today's date plus or minus one day". It
would be nice to have this range be configurable.

Photo selection is done by generating "find" commands.  In some cases, such as
a large number of entries in the "excludes" file, this command could become 
quite long - perhaps long enough to cause problems.

Similarly, the day's list of photos to be displayed is passed to the image 
display program ("fbi") on the command line.  This command too could become
long enough to cause problems.

The timing of when photo display starts and stops is defined by both a cron job
AND in the photo_frame_boot_start.sh script.  It would be nice to have a way to
define this timing in just one place to eliminate the opportunity for
inconsistencies.

Sometimes after a reboot, photo_frame starts and runs normally, but no images
are displayed.  Running the stop script followed by the start script resolves
the problem.  I don't know what is causing this. I've added a "chvt 2", which
*seems* to solve this issue, but I still don't really understand the issue
or why this would solve it.
