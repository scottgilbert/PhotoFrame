This code has a few built-in assumptions and limitations.

Here I will try to document these various "flaws":

For "anniversary" photo selection, photos are assumed to have the date they 
were taken somewhere in their path.  (either in a directory named with the 
date, or the filename itself) Further, this date is assumed to be in either 
`-MM-DD` or `MMDD_` format.

Inconsistency:  "recent" pictures are identified based on file mtime.  But, 
anniversary pictures are identified based on directory/file name, ignoring 
mtime.

The day's list of photos to be displayed is passed to the image display 
program (fbi/fim) on the command line.  This command could become long 
enough to cause problems. (Note: on my pi, "getconf ARG_MAX" returns
2097152.  The size of a typical day's photo list of 1700 photos is 75-90kB, so
I think the command length would have to be more than 20x longer before it hit
the limit.)

Originally, fbi was used to display images.  It seemed to crash occassionally,
I think when PNG images were included.  I've started to include an option to 
use fim instead of fbi.  Time will tell whether this turns out to be better
overall.

Similarly, photo selection is done by generating "find" commands.  In some 
cases, such as a large number of entries in the "excludes" file, this command 
could become quite long - perhaps long enough to cause problems. This should
only be an issue if someone really "went overboard" with their excludes file.

The timing of when photo display starts and stops is defined by both a cron job
AND in the photo_frame_boot_start.sh script.  It would be nice to have a way to
define this timing in just one place to eliminate the opportunity for
inconsistencies.

Sometimes after a reboot, photo_frame starts and runs normally, but no images
are displayed.  Running the stop script followed by the start script resolves
the problem.  I don't know what is causing this. I've added a "chvt 2", which
*seems* to solve this issue, but I still don't really understand the issue
or why this would solve it.
